Prerequisites: 
  - Have an account in PyPi
  - Choose a package name that is not already taken.
  - Have the code of the package directly on your local machine.
  - Install Twine with : pip3 install twine

Step 1 (Library Structure) : 
  - Have an __init__.py in your package folder
  - Have an setup.py at same level as your package
    Example of how your folder should look like:
      .
      ├── bio_volumentations (Package Folder)
      │   ├── __init__.py
      │   ├── 100IterationsTest.txt
      │   ├── ...
      └── setup.py

  - Ensure that your `setup.py` does not upload a version that has already been uploaded in the past.

Setup 2 (Upload):
  - When you are in the folder containing `setup.py` and your package, use the following command in your terminal to generate package files: python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    Example of how your folder should look like after the command:
    .
    ├── bio_volumentations
    ├── bio_volumentations.egg-info
    ├── build
    ├── dist
    └── setup.py

  - To upload the package, use this command in your terminal (in the same folder as the previous command): twine upload dist/*
  - Then, enter your API Token to upload the package (You can find this in your PyPi Account settings).
  - Your package is now uploaded to PyPi.
