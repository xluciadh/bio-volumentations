Releasing a new version:

1. Finalise the code.

2. Update the docstrings, descriptions, readme, non-generated .rst docu files under docs/source
   (such as intro.rst, index.rst, examples.rst, contributions.rst), ...

3. Update release version in docs/source/conf.py, pyproject.toml, and __version__.py.
   Update version-specific URLs in pyproject.toml and other files, e.g. in readme.md and docu files.

4. Create a gitlab tag for the last commit related to this version.

5. Upload the docs - logged in at readthedocs.org (first for the new version, then forward 'latest' to it).
   It is not necessary to have the newest html at gitlab because RTD will generate everything on its own.

6. Build pypi files and upload them to pypi - run the following commands:
python -m build
twine upload dist/*


*********************************************************************************

UPLOADING TO RTD

[modify 'docs/source/conf.py' for the correct version]
[push to gitlab]
[create a tag for the last commit]
[in RTD project management, activate "branch" with the name of the tag]
[build that branch]
[un-hide it]


*********************************************************************************

UPLOADING TO PYPI

[modify any files]
[modify 'pyproject.toml', especially the version field and documentation field]
