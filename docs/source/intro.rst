Introduction
============
`Bio-Volumentations` is an image augmentation and preprocessing package for 3D, 4D, and 5D biomedical images.

It offers a range of image transformations implemented efficiently for time-lapse multi-channel volumetric image data.
This includes both preprocessing transformations (such as intensity normalisation, padding, and type casting)
and augmentation transformations (such as affine transform, noise addition and removal, and contrast manipulation).

The `Bio-Volumentations` library is a suitable tool for data manipulation in machine learning applications.
Importantly, it can be used with any major Python deep learning library.

This library builds upon wide-spread libraries such as Albumentations (see the Contributions section below)
in terms of design and user interface. Therefore, it can easily be adopted by users.

The source codes and more details are also available `here <https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/cbia/bio-volumentations/-/tree/v1-1-0?ref_type=heads>`_.
